# Search Functionality

## Local Search[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#local-search)

Local search allows you to search within the currently displayed note. To initiate a local search, press CTRL-F. If using a web browser, this will be handled by the browser’s native search functionality. In the desktop (electron) version, a separate dialog will apear.

## Note Search[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#note-search)

Note search enables you to find notes by searching for text in the title, content, or  [attributes](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/attributes.html)  of the notes. You also have the option to save your searches, which will create a special search note which is visible on your navigation tree and contains the search results as sub-items.

To search for notes, click on the magnifying glass icon on the toolbar or press the  `CTRL-S`  keyboard  [shortcut](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/keyboard-shortcuts.html).

### Simple Note Search Examples[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#simple-note-search-examples)

-   `rings tolkien`: Full-text search to find notes containing both “rings” and “tolkien”.
-   `"The Lord of the Rings" Tolkien`: Full-text search where “The Lord of the Rings” must match exactly.
-   `note.content *=* rings OR note.content *=* tolkien`: Find notes containing “rings” or “tolkien” in their content.
-   `towers #book`: Combine full-text and attribute search to find notes containing “towers” and having the “book” label.
-   `towers #book or #author`: Search for notes containing “towers” and having either the “book” or “author” label.
-   `towers #!book`: Search for notes containing “towers” and not having the “book” label.
-   `#book #publicationYear = 1954`: Find notes with the “book” label and “publicationYear” set to 1954.
-   `#genre *=* fan`: Find notes with the “genre” label containing the substring “fan”. Additional operators include  `*=*`  for “contains”,  `=*`  for “starts with”,  `*=`  for “ends with”, and  `!=`  for “is not equal to”.
-   `#book #publicationYear >= 1950 #publicationYear < 1960`: Use numeric operators to find all books published in the 1950s.
-   `#dateNote >= TODAY-30`: A “smart search” to find notes with the “dateNote” label within the last 30 days. Supported smart values include NOW +- seconds, TODAY +- days, MONTH +- months, YEAR +- years.
-   `~author.title *=* Tolkien`: Find notes related to an author whose title contains “Tolkien”.
-   `#publicationYear %= '19[0-9]{2}'`: Use the ‘%=’ operator to match a regular expression (regex). This feature has been available since Trilium 0.52.

### Advanced Use Cases[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#advanced-use-cases)

-   `~author.relations.son.title = 'Christopher Tolkien'`: Search for notes with an “author” relation to a note that has a “son” relation to “Christopher Tolkien”. This can be modeled with the following note structure:
    -   Books
        -   Lord of the Rings
            -   label: “book”
            -   relation: “author” points to “J. R. R. Tolkien” note
    -   People
        -   J. R. R. Tolkien
            -   relation: “son” points to “Christopher Tolkien” note
            -   Christopher Tolkien
-   `~author.title *= Tolkien OR (#publicationDate >= 1954 AND #publicationDate <= 1960)`: Use boolean expressions and parentheses to group expressions. Note that expressions starting with a parenthesis need an “expression separator sign” (# or ~) prepended.
-   `note.parents.title = 'Books'`: Find notes with a parent named “Books”.
-   `note.parents.parents.title = 'Books'`: Find notes with a grandparent named “Books”.
-   `note.ancestors.title = 'Books'`: Find notes with an ancestor named “Books”.
-   `note.children.title = 'sub-note'`: Find notes with a child named “sub-note”.

### Search with Note Properties[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#search-with-note-properties)

Notes have properties that can be used in searches, such as  `noteId`,  `dateModified`,  `dateCreated`,  `isProtected`,  `type`,  `title`,  `text`,  `content`,  `rawContent`,  `ownedLabelCount`,  `labelCount`,  `ownedRelationCount`,  `relationCount`,  `ownedRelationCountIncludingLinks`,  `relationCountIncludingLinks`,  `ownedAttributeCount`,  `attributeCount`,  `targetRelationCount`,  `targetRelationCountIncludingLinks`,  `parentCount`,  `childrenCount`,  `isArchived`,  `contentSize`,  `noteSize`, and  `revisionCount`.

These properties can be accessed via the  `note.`  prefix, e.g.,  `note.type = code AND note.mime = 'application/json'`.

### Order by and Limit[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#order-by-and-limit)

```
#author=Tolkien orderBy #publicationDate desc, note.title limit 10

```

This example will:

1.  Find notes with the author label “Tolkien”.
2.  Order the results by  `publicationDate`  in descending order.
3.  Use  `note.title`  as a secondary ordering if publication dates are equal.
4.  Limit the results to the first 10 notes.

### Negation[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#negation)

Some queries can only be expressed with negation:

```
#book AND not(note.ancestor.title = 'Tolkien')

```

This query finds all book notes not in the “Tolkien” subtree.

## Under the Hood[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#under-the-hood)

### Label and Relation Shortcuts[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#label-and-relation-shortcuts)

The “full” syntax for searching by labels is:

```
note.labels.publicationYear = 1954

```

For relations:

```
note.relations.author.title *=* Tolkien

```

However, common label and relation searches have shortcut syntax:

```
#publicationYear = 1954
#author.title *=* Tolkien

```

### Separating Full-Text and Attribute Parts[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#separating-full-text-and-attribute-parts)

Search syntax allows combining full-text search with attribute-based search seamlessly. For example,  `tolkien #book`  contains:

1.  Full-text tokens -  `tolkien`
2.  Attribute expressions -  `#book`

Trilium detects the separation between full text search and attribute/property search by looking for certain special characters or words that denote attributes and properties (e.g., #, ~, note.). If you need to include these in full-text search, escape them with a backslash so they are processed as regular text:

```
"note.txt" 
\#hash 
#myLabel = 'Say "Hello World"'

```

### Escaping Special Characters[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#escaping-special-characters)

Special characters can be enclosed in quotes or escaped with a backslash to be used in full-text search:

```
"note.txt"
\#hash
#myLabel = 'Say "Hello World"'

```

Three types of quotes are supported: single, double, and backtick.

### Type Coercion[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#type-coercion)

Label values are technically strings but can be coerced for numeric comparisons:

```
note.dateCreated =* '2019-05'

```

This finds notes created in May 2019. Numeric operators like  `#publicationYear >= 1960`  convert string values to numbers for comparison.

## Auto-Trigger Search from URL[](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/search.html#auto-trigger-search-from-url)

You can open Trilium and automatically trigger a search by including the search  [url encoded](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/)  string in the URL:

`http://localhost:8080/#?searchString=abc`
